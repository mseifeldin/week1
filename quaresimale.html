    <p>
    	Preheat oven to 360 F. Put brown sugar, white sugar, flour, cinnamon, baking powder, butter, and almonds in a large mixing bowl. With mixer on low speed, add beaten eggs and vanilla. Mix just until dough holds together. Put dough on a floured surface. Cut in half. Roll each piece into a log and place on parchment-lined cookie sheet. Flatten each log slightly with palm of hand. Lightly brush the top of each log with egg wash. Bake for 25 mins or until firm to the touch. Remove from oven. Cut dough diagonally into biscotti. Return to 300 F oven until sufficiently dry.

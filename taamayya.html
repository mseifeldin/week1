    <ul>
        <li>1 C peeled, split fava beans, soaked overnight</li>
        <li>1 leek, dark part removed</li>
        <li>parsley to taste</li>
        <li>cilantro to taste</li>
        <li>1 T salt</li>
        <li>1/2 t baking soda</li>
        <li>sesame seeds</li>
        <li>whole coriander seeds</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Discard soaking water and combine fava beans with leek, parsley, cilantro, and salt in a food processor. Blend until you have a smooth paste. You can save this batter in the freezer or cook immediately. When you're ready to cook, add baking soda and mix well. Scoop into 1-2 T portions with a spoon and dip into a mixture of the sesame and coriander seeds. Flaten each portion into a paper towel to make a patty and absorb some excess moisture. Deep fry on medium high heat, using a small frying pan. Don't overcrowd the pan as they cook extremely quickly

    <h1>Sharkasayya</h1>

    <p>I think this was originally a Turkish dish, but my mom got this recipe from my grandmother.</p>

    <p>For the chicken:</p>

    <ul>

    	<li>1 chicken</li>
        <li>3-4 C water</li>
        <li>1 T salt</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>

    </ul>

    <p>for the sauce:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>3 & 3/4 C ground walnuts</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 t minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 slices french bread</li>
        <li>1/4 t salt</li>
        <li>1/2 T paprika</li>
        <li>1 t cayenne</li>
        <li>2 C chicken stock (can take from chicken prep)</li>
        <li>3 T vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 t (Hungarian) paprika</li>
        <li>walnut halves for garnish</li>
        <li>paprika oil (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <p> 
        Boil chicken in a pot with water, slat, onion, and carrot. Bring down to a simmer until cooked (about 45 mins). Remove skin and bones and tear into bite size pieces. Reserve stock for the sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remove crusts from bread and soak in shallow water for 5 minutes. Squeeze the bread dry and set aside. In a blender or food processor, combine walnuts, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, bread, cayenne, and paprika with 2 C of the chicken stock to make a thick sauce. Mix with chicken. Serve over rice and garnish with walnut halves and paprika oil.

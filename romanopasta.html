    <h1>Tom's Pasta</h1>

    <p>This is a recipe of our Italian friend and neighbor, Tom.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>1-2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>8 oz bacon or turkey bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>14 oz can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4-8 oz grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 lb spaghetti</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
    	Saute onions in olive oil until the color just starts to turn and add bacon. Stir and saute until bacon starts to crisp up. In the meantime, boil pasta in saltwater until al dente and save 1 cup of pasta water. When bacon is crisp, add garlic to frying pan. When the fragrance comes out, add the tomato sauce and simmer on low for at least 5 minutes; if the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit of water. When pasta is done and drained, return to pan or pot, whichever is more convenient and mix with sauce. Stir cheese in gradually, adding pasta water if it's too thick.
